# odin-rure

[Odin](http://odin-lang.org/) bindings for the [rust regex](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex) [C API](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/tree/master/regex-capi).

	"rure is a C API to Rust's regex library, which guarantees linear time searching using finite automata. In
	exchange, it must give up some common regex features such as backreferences and arbitrary lookaround. It does
	however include capturing groups, lazy matching, Unicode support and word boundary assertions. Its matching
	semantics generally correspond to Perl's, or "leftmost first." Namely, the match locations reported correspond to
	the first match that would be found by a backtracking engine."

## Why?

Rust regex is one of the [fastest regex libraries](https://github.com/rust-leipzig/regex-performance/blob/master/results_20221012.png) judging by many independent benchmarks.
Compared to the new Odin [text/regex](https://pkg.odin-lang.org/core/text/regex/) package it was 15x faster for a
particular use case. The API is small, easy to use and easy to create bindings for. Additionally it's easy to (re)build
the static libraries with the Rust `cargo` tooling, something that is often not true of larger CMAKE projects, even
with tools like `vcpkg`.

## Version

- `rure = "0.2.2"` which provides the C interface to Rust `regex = 1.*`

Prebuilt static `rure` libraries built against Rust regex version:

`1.10.6`

## API structure

- symbols named `rure_something` in the C API are presented as `rure.something` in the bindings
- `struct` types are capitalized (e.g. `rure_options` -> `rure.Options`)
- Odin `bit_set`s are used where a number is passed as a flag (e.g. `rure.Compile_Flags`)
- default parameters maybe provided where valid `NULL` (`nil`) parameters can be used in the C API (e.g. `rure.Options`,
  `rure.Error` parameters)
- most `rure` types are opaque structures (empty `struct`s hiding implementation details) - used via pointers

`rure.HAYSTACK_TEXT_P` and `rure.PATTERN_TEXT_P` are two distinct Odin types for `const uint8_t*`. Patterns must be
`UTF-8` in `rure` whilst haystacks (searched text) can be ascii or `UTF-8` (even other text encodings but you might not
match items properly). Rust regex is [clear that `UTF-8` is the only supported format for unicode](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/tree/master/regex-capi#text-encoding) - you must translate
other unicode formats such as `UTF-16` or `UTF-32`.

## Building the `rure` library (maybe optional)

- The static library `rure.lib` for Windows is shipped with the bindings in `./lib`
- The static library `librure.a` for Linux is shipped with the bindings in `./lib`
- standard rust tooling can (re)build the library on any platform if the prebuilt libraries are not suitable
	- `git clone https://github.com/rust-lang/regex.git`
	- `cd regex/regex-capi`
	- `cargo build --release`
	- See artifacts in `../target/release`, e.g. `rure.lib` on Windows and `librure.a` on Linux
	- Copy artifacts to ``./lib`

## Static library dependencies

When building the rust regex C API we can check extra static libraries that must be linked. These are included in the
Odin `foreign` definition for `rure`. You will get errors if they cannot be found on the system.

Windows:

	regex/regex-capi ‚ùØ cargo rustc -q -- --print=native-static-libs
	note: Link against the following native artifacts when linking against this static library. The order and any
	      duplication can be significant on some platforms.

	note: native-static-libs: legacy_stdio_definitions.lib kernel32.lib advapi32.lib ntdll.lib userenv.lib ws2_32.lib kernel32.lib /defaultlib:msvcrt

Linux using `librure.a`:

	-lgcc_s -lutil -lrt -lpthread -lm -ldl -lc
